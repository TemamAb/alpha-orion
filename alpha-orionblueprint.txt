Alpha Neon Enterprise Master Blueprint 1. System Overview (GCP-Optimized)
Alpha Neon is an institutional-grade arbitrage execution layer designed for high-frequency flash loan operations. It leverages ERC-4337 Account Abstraction via Pimlico Paymasters for gasless execution. The system is built on a serverless, event-driven architecture on Google Cloud, ensuring high scalability, low latency, and robust observability.

3. The Tri-Tier Bot Architecture (GCP Implementation)
Each bot will be implemented as a Cloud Run service , enabling independent scaling, rapid deployment, and a pay-per-use cost model. Communication between bots will be asynchronous via Pub/Sub topics .

Scanner Bot ( alpha-neon-scanner ) :
Purpose: Continuous mempool monitoring for DEX price disparities.
GCP Implementation: Cloud Run service, configured for high concurrency and low latency. Deployed in a GCP region geographically optimized for proximity to blockchain nodes and Flashbots RPC endpoints.
Output: Publishes raw, filtered mempool events to alpha-neon-scanner-output .
Orchestrator Bot ( alpha-neon-orchestrator ) :
Purpose: Decision engine. Consumes mempool events, queries Vertex AI (Gemini) to validate strategy ROI against current gas-sponsorship limits, and fetches liquidity depth data.
GCP Implementation: Cloud Run service, triggered by messages from alpha-neon-scanner-output .
Integrations:
Communicates with Vertex AI to access Gemini models for strategy forging.
Uses Memorystore for Redis ( alpha-neon-redis ) for high-speed caching of real-time market data, external API responses (e.g., BitQuery, DexTools), and intermediate strategy states.
Retrieves external API keys (BitQuery, DexTools Premium, Etherscan Pro) from Secret Manager ( alpha-neon-api-keys ).
Output: Publishes validated arbitrage opportunities to alpha-neon-orchestrator-output . Logs strategy decisions and relevant data to BigQuery ( alpha-neon-analytics ) for analytics.
Executor Bot ( alpha-neon-executor ) :
Purpose: The "Relay." Batches Flash Loan + Swap + Repayment into a single UserOperation for the Pimlico Bundler.
GCP Implementation: Cloud Run service, triggered by messages from alpha-neon-orchestrator-output .
Integrations:
Interacts directly with blockchain networks (Arbitrum/Base) and Pimlico Bundler/Paymaster.
Uses Secret Manager ( alpha-neon-db-credentials and alpha-neon-api-keys ) for secure storage of blockchain private keys and other sensitive execution credentials.
May use Memorystore for Redis ( alpha-neon-redis ) for very short-lived execution state or rate limiting.
Output: Logs detailed transaction outcomes (success/failure, profit/loss, gas used) to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL ( alpha-neon-tx-db ) for operational records and to BigQuery ( alpha-neon-analytics ) for long-term analytics.
4. Data & AI Layer (GCP Services)
Transaction Database ( alpha-neon-tx-db ) :
GCP Service: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.
Purpose: Stores critical, persistent operational data such as executed trades, wallet balances, strategy performance metrics, and audit trails. Configured for high availability.
High-Speed Cache ( alpha-neon-redis ) :
GCP Service: Memorystore for Redis.
Purpose: Provides ultra-low latency access to frequently changing market data, external API responses, and transient state needed by the Orchestrator and Executor bots.
Analytics Warehouse ( alpha-neon-analytics ) :
GCP Service: BigQuery.
Purpose: Centralized repository for all historical data (mempool events, strategy decisions, execution results, market data). Enables deep analytical queries, machine learning model training, and dashboarding.
AI Core Management ( arbinexus-vertex-ai ) :
GCP Service: Vertex AI.
Purpose: Provides a managed platform for deploying and managing Gemini models. Offers better control over model versions, access, and potentially higher throughput than direct public API access.
5. Security & Management (GCP Services)
Secrets Management ( alpha-neon-db-credentials , alpha-neon-api-keys ) :
GCP Service: Secret Manager.
Purpose: Securely stores all sensitive credentials (database passwords, blockchain private keys, external API keys for BitQuery, DexTools, Etherscan Pro, Flashbots RPC).
Messaging Backbone ( alpha-neon-scanner-output , alpha-neon-orchestrator-output ) :
GCP Service: Pub/Sub.
Purpose: Provides asynchronous, reliable, and scalable communication between the bot services, decoupling them and improving overall system resilience.
Observability:
GCP Services: Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging, Cloud Trace.
Purpose: Comprehensive monitoring of bot performance, resource utilization, and transaction flows. Centralized logging for debugging and auditing.
6. Execution Workflow (The "Loop" - Upgraded)
Detection : alpha-neon-scanner finds a disparity > 0.3% and publishes to alpha-neon-scanner-output .
Strategy Forge : alpha-neon-orchestrator consumes the event, retrieves relevant API keys from alpha-neon-api-keys , queries arbinexus-vertex-ai (Gemini) with discovery context, and fetches liquidity data via external APIs (cached in alpha-neon-redis ).
Validation : alpha-neon-orchestrator confirms ROI, logs strategy decision to alpha-neon-analytics , and publishes validated opportunity to alpha-neon-orchestrator-output .
Sponsorship : alpha-neon-executor consumes the event, retrieves blockchain private keys from alpha-neon-api-keys , and triggers Pimlico Paymaster for gas sponsorship.
Atomic Execution : alpha-neon-executor triggers the flash loan contract via Flashbots RPC.
Settlement : Profits swept to Primary AA Wallet. alpha-neon-executor logs detailed execution results to alpha-neon-tx-db and alpha-neon-analytics
