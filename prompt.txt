"Authorize Gemini AI Assist to fully plan and implement 
the creation of a Google Cloud Monitoring dashboard on 
the Google Cloud server. The dashboard must precisely 
mirror the design specified by the configuration found 
within the directory path: /home/iamtemam/alpha-orion/frontend/src/pages/ .

Gemini AI Assist should analyze the contents 
of this directory to extract the dashboard's layout, widgets, 
and metric configurations. If the design is not in a directly 
importable Google Cloud Monitoring JSON format, Gemini AI Assist 
is empowered to perform the necessary conversion, extraction, or 
interpretation to recreate the dashboard's visual and functional
 specifications accurately.

Ensure the implemented dashboard for the 'alpha-orion' arbitrage 
flash loan application includes all key performance indicators, 
with particular emphasis on profit metrics 
and transaction success rates. Assume my 
application is already configured to 
emit these custom metrics to Cloud Monitoring."
