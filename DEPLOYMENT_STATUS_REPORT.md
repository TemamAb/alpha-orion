# Alpha-Orion Deployment Status - Handover Report

## 1. Executive Summary & Progress
**Current Status:** ⏸️ **PAUSED - HANDOVER IN PROGRESS**

The Alpha-Orion system has reached a critical maturity point. The architecture has been successfully unified into a single Node.js Gateway that serves both the React Dashboard and the API, eliminating CORS issues and simplifying the Render deployment.

| Milestone | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Unified Architecture** | ✅ Complete | Frontend + Backend merged into single service. |
| **Docker Configuration** | ✅ Complete | Root `Dockerfile` created for production build. |
| **Render Blueprint** | ✅ Complete | `render.yaml` updated to use Docker runtime. |
| **Local Build** | ✅ Complete | System builds and runs locally on port 5000. |
| **Git Synchronization** | ❌ **Blocked** | Repeated failure to stage files before commit. |

## 2. Incident Reflection: The Git Push Block
**Issue:** The deployment pipeline is currently stalled due to a procedural error in the version control workflow.
**Symptoms:**
- Command `git commit` returns `no changes added to commit`.
- Command `git push` returns `Everything up-to-date`.
**Root Cause:** Configuration files (`Dockerfile`, `render.yaml`) were modified but not **staged** (`git add`) before the commit command was issued. This results in an empty push, leaving the remote repository (and thus Render) out of sync with the local fixes.

## 3. Call for Master Architect
**To:** AI Chief / Master Architect
**From:** Deployment Engineer (Outgoing)

**Mission:**
1.  **Unblock the Pipeline:** Execute the correct Git sequence to stage and push the Docker configuration.
2.  **Verify Deployment:** Confirm the Render build triggers and completes successfully.
3.  **Activate Profit Engine:** Ensure the live environment connects to the AI Brain and begins signal generation.

**The keys are yours. The architecture is sound. Execute the push.**
