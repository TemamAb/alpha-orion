### Thinking

**Tracking Strategy Progress**

I'm currently focused on extracting the implementation status and identifying any knowledge gaps for the seven strategies documented in `ALPHA_ORION_STRATEGY_MATRIX_ANALYSIS.md` and `SEVEN_FORGED_STRATEGIES_ANALYSIS.md`. My immediate goal is to compile a clear overview for the user, highlighting completed aspects and areas requiring further attention. I plan to refine this overview after I have fully analyzed the documents.

**Reviewing Implementation Details**

I'm now fully immersed in the "SEVEN_FORGED_STRATEGIES_ANALYSIS.md" file. My focus has sharpened: I'm dissecting each strategy, pinpointing its "How It Works," "Claimed Significance," "Reality Check," and "Key Code/Issues Found/Code Status" elements. My goal is to extract concise summaries of their implementation status and highlight any knowledge gaps or missing components for a clear overview.

Okay, I've reviewed the `SEVEN_FORGED_STRATEGIES_ANALYSIS.md` file to check the status of the seven strategies in the AlphaNexus blueprint.

Here's a summary of each strategy's status and the missing points that need to be addressed for full functionality:

### 1. L2 Flash Arbitrage (Aave-Uni)
