# Alpha-Orion Production Deployment Progress

## Current Status: READY - Unified Service Architecture

### What Was Fixed (Completed ✅)

1.  **Unified Service Architecture**: The frontend dashboard and backend API have been merged into a single Node.js service. This simplifies deployment, eliminates CORS issues, and reduces infrastructure costs.
    -   **Files changed**: `render.yaml`, `backend-services/services/user-api-service/src/index.js`, `dashboard/src/components/DataHydrator.tsx`
    -   **Status**: ✅ Code and deployment configuration updated.

2.  **Startup Dependencies Removed**: The backend no longer requires Redis/PostgreSQL or a `JWT_SECRET` to start, allowing it to run in a lightweight or simulation mode.
    -   **Status**: ✅ Code fixed and pushed to main branch.

### Deployment Preparation Complete ✅

- ✅ `render.yaml` (v5.0) configured for a **single unified web service**.
- ✅ Build command now compiles the React frontend and installs backend dependencies.
- ✅ Start command runs the Node.js server, which serves both the API and the static frontend.
- ✅ Frontend is configured to call the API on the same domain.

### Next Steps for Deployment (Simplified)

The code is ready. Deployment to Render is now much simpler:

1.  **Go to Render Dashboard**: https://dashboard.render.com/
2.  **Create a new "Blueprint" instance.**
3.  **Connect your GitHub repository.**
4.  Render will automatically detect and use the `render.yaml` file to deploy the `alpha-orion-alpha` service.
5.  **Set Secrets**: Manually set the following environment variables in the Render dashboard for your service (under the "Environment" tab):
    -   `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    -   `PRIVATE_KEY`
    -   `FLASH_LOAN_EXECUTOR_ADDRESS`
    -   `PIMLICO_API_KEY`
    -   *(Optional)* If you want to use a database and cache for full features, create PostgreSQL and Redis instances on Render and add their connection URLs (`DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`) to the environment variables.

### Current Live Deployment

| Service             | URL                                       | Status             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Unified App (FE+BE) | https://alpha-orion-alpha.onrender.com | 🚀 READY TO DEPLOY |

### To Activate Profit Mode

Once the unified service is deployed:

1.  Access the dashboard at `https://alpha-orion-alpha.onrender.com`.
2.  The profit engine will be running in the mode configured on the backend (`production` or `signal`).

**Handoff Complete** - The successor should focus on deploying the unified service via the `render.yaml` blueprint on Render.
