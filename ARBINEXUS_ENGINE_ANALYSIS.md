## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Why Zero Revenue?

#### 1. **No Active Trading Nodes** 🔴
```
Active Units: 0 Connected Nodes
```
- Engine is running but has no active trading nodes
- No nodes = No arbitrage execution = No profits
- **Action Required**: Connect trading nodes to execute strategies

#### 2. **Wallet Not Connected for Settlements** 🔴
```
Settlement Address: Not Connected
Transfer Yield: Not Connected
```
- Even if trades execute, profits can't be settled
- No settlement address = No profit collection
- **Action Required**: Connect settlement wallet

#### 3. **Theoretical vs Actual Performance** ⚠️
```
Gains Per Run: $29.66 (claimed)
Actual Cluster Yield: $0.00
```
- Metrics show theoretical performance, not actual
- 96 runs claimed but $0 actual revenue
- **Conclusion**: These are simulated/demo values

#### 4. **Champion Discovery Matrix Empty** ⚠️
```
Alpha Strategy: No data
Champion Wallet: No data
PnL (24h): No data
```
- No discovered profitable strategies
- No champion wallets being tracked
- **Action Required**: Enable strategy discovery
